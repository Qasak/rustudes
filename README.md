rust version of [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/)'s [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)


"An étude (a French word meaning study) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)



This project contains rustudes—Rust programs, usually short, for perfecting particular programming skills.

# Who is this for?
To continue the musical analogy, some people think of programming like [Spotify](http://spotify.com/): they want to know how to install the app, find a good playlist, and hit the "play" button; after that they don't want to think about it. There are plenty of other tutorials that will tell you how to do the equivalent of that for various programming tasks—this one won't help. But if you think of programming like playing the piano—a craft that can take [years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) to perfect—then I hope this collection can help.
