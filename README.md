rust version of [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/)'s [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes)


"An étude (a French word meaning study) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)


The original project was written in python, rust is a language that I am studying and one that many of you would like to learn more about. I hope that this project will lead you to see interesting applications of rust in different contexts and bring rust to a wider range of applications.

# Who is this for?
To continue the musical analogy, some people think of programming like [Spotify](http://spotify.com/): they want to know how to install the app, find a good playlist, and hit the "play" button; after that they don't want to think about it. There are plenty of other tutorials that will tell you how to do the equivalent of that for various programming tasks—this one won't help. But if you think of programming like playing the piano—a craft that can take [years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) to perfect—then I hope this collection can help.
